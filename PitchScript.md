"We all know that the best opportunities come through people we already know — but today’s networking platforms make it surprisingly hard to find who we actually know.
If I want to hire someone, learn a new skill, or get an introduction, I end up scrolling through hundreds of names on LinkedIn or hoping I remember who in my network knows the right person. And in every hiring cycle at my company, I’ve seen the same thing: the strongest hires almost always come from trusted connections — we just don’t have a good way to search them.
Our product fixes this.
This isn’t just a convenience upgrade — it meaningfully improves how people hire and connect.
For recruiters, it removes hours of manual searching and instantly surfaces the strongest, most trusted candidates in their existing network.
 For candidates, it turns cold applications into warm, personal introductions through real connections.
 And for mutual connections, it makes helping effortless — the system highlights when they can bridge two people who should meet.
In short, it speeds up hiring, strengthens introductions, and unlocks opportunities that are already hidden in your network.
We built a platform that imports your public connections across LinkedIn, Instagram, Handshake and more, and turns your entire multi-platform network into a searchable knowledge graph. An LLM automatically interprets skills, roles, and experience from public profiles, so instead of searching for names, you can search for expertise, experience, or desired roles.
Ask the system:
“Who in my network has done robotics at Tesla?”
“Who’s two degrees away from me and knows biotech fundraising?”
“Who do I know that could help me hire a backend engineer?”
And instantly, you get the best matches — filtered by platform, mutual connections, education, degree of separation, and more. Plus, you can visually explore how everyone is connected through an interactive, LLM-clustered network graph.
Ethically, we’re strict:
Only public data, no hidden scraping, and users control visibility. If someone gets added through a public connection, they’re notified and can opt in or dispute it.
**In short: we’re building the first networking tool that actually uses your network.
Not another feed, not another job board — but a real, intelligent way to find the right people through the relationships you already have."
