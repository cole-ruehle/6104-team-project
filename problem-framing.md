# Problem Framing
## Domain
A digital meal ordering system that enables students to submit menu or custom food requests directly to chefs, who can view and manage incoming orders in real time.


## Problem
Many dinging solutions for students involve allowing students to order specific custome meal versions. Things like ordering an omlet, stir fry or a buerget are often done through long queues where the chef ust remember what each has ordered and cook them while student have to wait in long lines for their food. A solution to this would be to allow for requests to be put in early and worked on so that they are prepared for when people arrive. 

## Evidence

Our chef, who is on a lunch contract with us, prepares around 50 meals each day, including one daily special and six staple menu items. One major challenge is that students who cannot attend lunch in person currently have to place their orders through Google Sheets, which only allows for food pickup at the end of lunch. Meanwhile, students who are in a hurry often have to ask friends to notify the chef to start preparing their orders early. The chef has specifically requested a system like ours to streamline this process. Additionally, other students use gear grilling, a similar service, but it only allows for preparation at the end since it is not a live system. Finally, some students have reported waiting in long lines at locations like Simmons and Baker just to get standard meals.
